Privacy Policy
Last updated: 19th February 2026
This Privacy Policy explains how Reelcut AI by Blank Canvas Design Co. handles and protects your data. By using the app, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described below.

1. General Information
Reelcut AI is a subscription-based app that enables users to create and edit videos using AI-powered reel templates and creative tools. The app stores all user-generated content (e.g., photos, videos, edits) exclusively on the user’s device unless otherwise stated.
Certain non-personal data is processed via third-party services to improve app performance and provide features such as analytics, crash reporting, and AI processing.

2. Data Collection and Transmission
We do not collect or store any personal data from users. However, Reelcut AI uses third-party services for specific purposes:
Firebase Analytics: Tracks app usage to enhance performance.
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
Firebase Crashlytics: Collects crash reports to help fix technical issues.
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
These services may collect non-personal data such as device type, operating system version, and app interaction logs.
If AI-based features are used, limited media data may be processed temporarily to generate results. Such processing is used only for providing requested features and is not stored by us.

3. Data Retention
All user-generated content (e.g., photos, videos) is stored locally on your device. We do not store or retain any personal content on our servers.
Any data transmitted to third-party services (e.g., Firebase) is used for real-time processing and analytics purposes and is not stored by us.

4. User Control and Data Deletion
You have full control over your data. Deleting the app from your device will permanently erase all associated data stored locally.
We do not retain any of your personal content after the app is deleted.

5. Third-Party Data Processing
The app uses third-party services to enhance functionality. These services are governed by their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review them for more details:

6. Security
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect data processed through the app. While we prioritize security, no method of transmission over the internet is entirely secure.
We recommend enabling device security features, such as passcodes or biometric authentication, to safeguard your data.

7. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. You will be notified of any significant updates through an app update.
The latest version of the Privacy Policy will always be available in the app and on our website.
